Summary of Steps to Complete the Project
1. Project Setup

Frontend Setup:
Install Node.js and npm.
Create a React project using Create React App.

Backend Setup:
Install Python and Django.
Create a new Django project and app.
Install Django REST Framework.


2. Frontend Development (React)

Initialize React Project:
    Use Create React App to set up a new React project.
    Organize the project structure with components, styles, and assets.
Build UI Components:
    Hero Section: Implement the landing page with the hero text, CTA, and "How It Works" section.
    Message Composition Page: Integrate ReactQuill for the rich text editor.
    Implement a date picker for scheduling the message.
    Create a form to capture the message content and scheduled date.
Styling and Responsiveness:
    Apply CSS or a library like Bootstrap to ensure the app is visually appealing and works well on different devices.


3. Backend Development (Django)

Set Up Django Project:
    Initialize a new Django project and create necessary apps (e.g., messages).
    Configure settings for database, static files, and installed apps.
Create Django Models:
    Define a model to temporarily store the message content and scheduled delivery time.
Implement API with Django REST Framework:
    Create serializers for the Message model to convert data to JSON format.
Develop API endpoints to handle:
    Creating a new message (POST request).
    Retrieving message data (if needed for frontend validation or confirmation).
Integrate Celery and Redis:
    Set up Celery for asynchronous task management.
    Use Redis as the message broker to handle task scheduling.
    Implement Celery tasks to send the email at the scheduled time.


4. Integration

Connect Frontend and Backend:
    Use Axios or Fetch API in React to send POST requests to the Django backend.
    Ensure data from the frontend is correctly stored in the backend and scheduled for delivery.
Testing and Validation:
    Test the message scheduling and sending functionality thoroughly.
    Ensure messages are sent at the correct time and data is deleted after sending.


5. Deployment

Prepare for Deployment:
    Set up environment variables for sensitive data like email credentials.
    Optimize the app for production by building the React app and configuring Django for production use.
Choose a Free Hosting Service:
    Deploy the Django backend on platforms like Heroku or Railway.
    Deploy the React frontend on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
Deploy Celery and Redis:
    Use free-tier services like Heroku Redis or set up a Redis server for handling background tasks.
    Ensure the Celery worker is running on the deployed server.


6. Post-Deployment

Monitor and Maintain:
    Regularly check the app for bugs or issues.
    Collect feedback to improve the app.
Future Enhancements:
    Based on user feedback, consider adding features like user authentication or more robust data management.
